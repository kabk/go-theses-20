            <h3>Working Environments — Investigating Nature in the Workplace</h3>
            <p> When God created man he imbued him with the
              ability to create and gave him the Garden of
              Eden as a home.</p>
            <p>
              In this thesis I would like to explore what
              is commonly known as ‘work–life balance’ and
              how it has evolved over past, present and future
              from the standpoint of the garden.
            </p>
            <p>The Garden is used in this thesis in the
              sense of a designed landscape of mediation
              between nature and culture, since it embodies
              different levels of human control over
              wilderness. It will serve as an angle through
              which to study the worker and his environment.
            </p>
            <p> Professions in the creative industry have
              historically boasted several key figures that
              proudly proclaim their love for nature. However
              Graphic Design appears to be lacking in this
              regard. It has traditionally been a practice that
              takes place indoors; it is a field that doesn’t
              possess any real need for nature as it serves
              as a vessel for culture, which has often been
              positioned as nature’s antithesis.
            </p>
            <p> Could the Graphic Designer’s workplace
              ever be in nature? Does becoming a Graphic
              Designer demand a sacrifice of life outdoors?
              Does it entail negative consequences for the
              general wellbeing of the designer—and more
              broadly, for the general wellbeing of the planet?

            <h3>De deepfake als een nieuwe manifestatie van een nep-identiteit</h3>
            <p> Voor deze scriptie is er onderzoek gedaan naar
              theorieën omtrent identiteit. Hierbij is de
              focus gelegd op het fenomeen van online (nep)
              identiteiten, het creëren van deze identiteit en de
              gevolgen hiervan. De komst van sociale media en
              bijbehorende nepprofielen laten een hedendaagse
              wereld zien waarin mensen zich gemakkelijker
              dan ooit, op een andere manier voor kunnen
              doen dan ze in werkelijkheid zijn. Door onderzoek
              te doen naar deze conventionele manieren
              van het creëren van een (online)nep-identiteit,
              ontdekken we waarom nepprofielen wel of niet
              werken. Daarnaast kijken we naar een nieuw
              verschijnsel dat gebruikt kan worden als vorm
              van een online nep-identiteit; de deepfake. In de
              media zien we vooral voorbeelden van deepfakes
              die vragen oproepen over de gevaren hiervan, en
              of de betrouwbaarheid van informatie in gevaar
              komt omdat gemanipuleerd beeldmateriaal
              niet meer van echt te onderscheiden is. Denk
              hierbij aan wereldleiders die speeches oplezen
              van mensen met geheel andere (politieke) ideeën
              en bedoelingen. We zullen speculeren welke
              impact deze techniek heeft op de door onszelf
              gecreëerde identiteit “The Bloodthirsty”. In het
              geval van onze professionele darter zullen we
              gaan kijken tot hoe ver het mogelijk is om deze
              (geloofwaardig) online te belichamen. Later zal
              duidelijk worden of de identiteit sterk genoeg is
              om ook offline te overleven.

            <h3>Insights into Outdoor Experiences</h3>
            <p> After hitting a low point in my study I
              decided to take some time off and make a big
              bicycle trip through the forests of Sweden and
              Denmark. Despite all the challenges I faced
              during this trip it sincerely lifted my spirits.
              This made me wonder what it actually was that
              the trip offered me that I missed in my daily
              life. I decided to analyze my own adventure by
              comparing it to similar experiences of others.
              Afterwards I reinforced my findings with already
              written texts and research. Does an outdoor
              experience contain something that can increase
              the quality of our lives?
            </p>
            <p>
              The success of my trip lies in the feeling
              of control it gave me. Our modern lives are filled
              with anxieties, that are difficult to get a grip on.
              My outdoor experience countered this feeling
              of helplessness. The overcoming of the mental
              and physical challenges I had to face during my
              journey boosted my confidence immensely. I
              named this experience and similar experiences,
              real experiences. These are experiences that
              seem scary and challenging at first but end up
              to be full of learning, joy and personal growth.

            <h3>The Pillars of Christianity and Capitalism</h3>
            <p> The origins of this thesis can be found in Ouderkerk aan
              den IJssel, a small religious town situated in the Dutch Bible
              Belt. It is the town where I grew up and lived for two decades.
              I always felt completely out of place within the religious
              and social structures the church created. I had trouble with
              the hierarchy, surveillance and restrictions that were telling
              me how to live, how to behave, and how to be as a person.
              After moving away from this environment I found the space
              to think about these things, which I did extensively over the
              past few years. This kind of liberation was necessary to realise
              how conflicting some power structures, hierarchies and
              ideologies are.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this thesis I explore if capitalism can be considered as a
              by-product of Christianity and, if so, how these two are intertwined.
              I connect the core values of the Christian church
              directly to the core values of capitalism. My research isn’t
              only executed behind the computer or in a library, but also
              includes important conversations, reflections on experiences,
              insider knowledge and even entering sacred spaces.
              This research resulted in a, sometimes confronting, but
              remarkable analysis and reflection of our western capitalistic
              society.

              Questions like who has the right over the land and how

              will play a complementary role in the thesis. Moreover, I

            <h3>Queering the Social Soup</h3>
            <p> Long-established rituals around food represent the current
              metabolic regime we are "living" in. All of organic life was
              spontaneously arose from the alleged primordial soup,
              intrinsically linking everything through this chemical broth,
              yet something went awry, and humans strayed from the
              kindred. Through diversified examples of metabolic systems,
              I would like to evoke a rekindling with the entirety
              through ingestion, digestion and discharge.
            </p>
            <p>A tracing of metabolic processes on a venture to queer
              our relationship with more-than-human beings through the
              lens of ingestion and rewrite the social contract between
              animate and inanimate beings. Treating the universe as
              a soup —parts of which, through consumption we either
              assimilate or eject — in order to shift the mainstream
              perception of food rituals as generic survival mechanisms.
              Looking at food as much more than an energy source, it
              powers tentacular communication through its many forces
              and materialities.
            </p>
            <p>Metabolic processes and ideology such as the primordial
              soup theory, cooking as the catalyzer of the nature
              —culture rift, comradeship, and going all the way to the
              microbe and fermentation. All aiming to bring about a new
              sense of how humans alter their surroundings by ways of
              interaction with active and passive forces.
            </p>
            <p>Food is the medium of choice in this discourse as it is
              internalized through nearly all the senses. It creates a sensibility
              towards universal and local cycles where a dialogue
              may not seem legitimate. This dialogue is not represented in
              words, rather through a metabolic, spiritual and aesthetical
              gesture. The text works as an organism by mirroring the
              anthropic digestive tract and its distinctive processes.

            <h3>Rhythm of Residing:
              Contemporary Music as a Tool for Self-knowledge</h3>
            <p> This thesis tells a story of an European-born person from
              African descent, me. I’m reflecting on the urgency of healing,
              dwelling, memorising and forgetting, concerning postcolonial
              thinking and self-government. I feel disconnected from the
              country my grandparents come from because I wasn’t born
              there plus I don’t speak the language.
            </p>
            <p>
              How do I, born in Europe coming from African diaspora,
              deal with this process in the form of music? Is it even up to
              me to as a person of colour to find ways to improve postcolonial
              thinking? I’m researching artists that experiment with
              sound and visuals in order to create new narratives within
              post-colonialism. By analysing musical lyrics and looking at visuals,
              I could relate it to my knowledge in contemporary music.
            </p>
            <p>
              Perhaps I could develop a clearer understanding of the
              country and the people I originally come from. Coming from a
              creative background moving more and more towards my musical
              needs, I question if music can be a greater part in the way we
              use the archive as we know it now as a tool for self-knowledge.

            <h3>The Phenomenon of Private Press. Printing as a form of resistnace and activism.</h3>
            <p>
              Private press has always represented
              a certain form of activism and the
              content produced in such environments
              has shaped their specific societal
              settings by establishing an important
              medium to reflect current moods.
              The voice of the citizens was in many
              cases suppressed and censored by
              authorities or entire governments. The
              sociopolitical context in which people
              found themselves resulted in resistance,
              taking various forms. However,
              when it comes to resisting private press
              initiatives turned out to be one of the
              most crucial and powerful means. The
              conditions under which these groups or
              individuals were producing, printing,
              and distributing their materials were
              oftentimes extreme across many countries,
              cultures, and systems. Examples
              run from a secret print house in a well
              in Georgia, through the internment
              camps in communist Poland where
              arrested oppositionist were able to
              assemble a printer from a piece of glass,
              rubber from shoe soles, and distilled
              ink from pens, to the squatters printing
              in various places in Europe with their
              stencil machines. This phenomenon
              show that harsh conditions were in
              fact not an insurmountable obstacle to
              create the platform of resistance but
              rather a stimulant and encouragement
              for bravery and persistence.

            <h3>A Stroll With Pulsion</h3>
            <p>
              I’m a girl, I’m french, and I want to talk
              about love. “Of course!” you must be
              thinking right now.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even if Rilke would judge me too young
              to talk about love, I am gonna take the risk
              and introduce you to Pulsion, a psychic
              drive or an instinctual urge that provokes
              a carnal desire for someone other than
              your partner. Opposite to Eros who is very
              faithful and regular, Pulsion, is ungraspable.
              Through its strong aesthetic full of
              artifice, Pulsion can appear in a multitude
              of forms. To answer my questions around
              the cultural representations and connotation
              of a sexual attraction outside an

              us to follow his meandering walk around several different gardens, as a performative reflexion.

            <h3>Illusive Sauce and Invisible Flights</h3>
            <p>
              They said that anadromous fish, like salmon, trout
              or cá linh migrate from one body of water to the
              other to reproduce.
            </p>
            <p>
              It started almost like a horror movie themed with Holocaust,
              yet this time with scattering bodies of fish instead of human, big and
              small, buried half under the sand and half above the water. The smell of
              rotten marine animals, heavily fuming all over Ha Tinh, Vietnam, would
              intoxicate any citizen who dared to take a bite of these deadly creatures.
              Yet as the fish dissolved into the ground they collided with the bodies
              of many human beings, buried there fifty years ago when the city of Hue
              was heavily massacred. In 2019, 39 Vietnamese people from the same
              town were given the chance to live yet they chose to die, not in their
              own land but somewhere far away. Illegally. The three different narratives,
              separated by time and space, eventually came together as one: the
              sum of an overly stressed piece of land. The flux that was established
              through these different time-space events revealed the inner structure
              of violence and crimes. Their consequences, once had been triggered,
              continue to transform, penetrate, and influence as they sail through and
              overlap one another.

              Meanwhile in Iceland, 2010, a volcano erupted like a real catastrophe.

              “For the first time, Europe turned into a real physical

              spatial and temporal coordinates.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Flight industries were stagnated. Other dependencies? Convulsed.
              For 8 days, Europe seemed to have come to an end. But far away
              in the crowd, in the myriad of those vexed tempers, a tiny voice set
              forth a demand: “Test the planes! Test the planes! We need to fly!” and
              at an ineffable speed, the world hasted back to its norms. The norms of

            <p>
              The Earth is 75% water. Its atmosphere are majorly nitrogen,
              oxygen and carbon dioxide. A slight disruption to this ratio, in a matter
              of time, would throw us all into chaos. But these elements are not what
              we consume. What we consume is fish sauce—something delicious,
              something exotic, something fun! However, sauce is water: it is nitrogen,
              oxygen as well as carbon dioxide. It is the omnipresence that runs
              the factories, drives the cars, flies the airplanes. It is also the tsunami,
              the earthquake and the hurricane. It is a fluid that is embedded in the
              flux. And once it tumbles, it crumbles the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              “The Earth is evil.” We ate a sauce and it made disasters! But
              what compassion there is for us when we are forever ruled by the language
              of the old? When our dogmatic system is indestructible? Can we
              even speak about our wrong doing? Let us not speak, let us “taste”.

            <h3>The Alchemical Recipe for Data Transmutation</h3>
            <p>The Alchemical arts, technology and the historical
              art of memory are connected in more ways that one
              could possibly imagine. Daily, we store and recollect
              information and imagery inside the architecture of our
              minds and transform the worth according to our inner
              hierarchical file system.<sup class='fn'>1</sup> The structure in which we
              store memory has been explored by many throughout
              history, especially by those interested in the occult.
              Combining the alchemy of the mind and computing
              terms, I wish to explore the space in which memory
              is stored through the eyes of the contemporary artist.
              The exploration dives both in the physical and the
              digital, for many of the memory system, such as ‘The
              Theatre of the World’ by Robert Fludd, are based on
              an architectural structure surrounding logic and order,
              very much like the modern algorithm. In this thesis,
              I will research the deeper connection between the
              transmutation <sup class='fn'>2</sup> of value within the Alchemical arts in
              correlation to memory and the methods of archiving
              and data storage in the digital realm, questioning if
              modern tools such as the algorithm and the hard drive
              could be the contemporary alchemical ingredients that
              together create the recipe for the transmutation of data.</p>

              Schoonheid wordt toegekend door de mens, het is niet iets wat op
              zichzelf staat. Maar hoe besluiten we of iets over schoonheid beschikt?
              Of iemand voldoet aan het ideaal of hier juist van afwijkt?
              Schoonheid lijkt gepresenteerd alsof het meetbaar is. Wat is het

              What are the aesthetics of ‘green’?
              I am here to answer that question and to hold graphic designers
              accountable for addressing, visually and conceptually, the
              nuances of the ecological crisis. Visual culture has neglected
              the issue for a long time and that has resulted in a lethal lack
              of public attention and discourse <span>*</span>. Neglect in a form of literal
              neglect, not touching the issue, as well as neglect in the form
              of repetition, in allowing it to become a static visual of green
              nature, femininity and non-human-culture. A static visual that
              predominantly appeals to a certain type of person. Which
              in turn causes it to appeal less to other types of people...
              The fear of being stereotyped is a force to be reckoned with!
              And I have grown bitter.

              Since 2018 when Greta Thunberg and her protest sign, black
              on white “Skolstrejk för klimatet”, started gaining momentum,
              the climate crisis has become a hot topic. Since then practices
              and projects related to the issue have popped up all over the
              field of graphic design. A new generation has managed to get
              out of the rut, and seems to be aiming to keep it cool.

                factors, but I will claim that this “neglect” or
                oversight has been impactful in determining
                the [low] level of public interest. The power of

              Een zoektocht naar de rol van grafisch
              ontwerp in het digitale landschap van
              muziekstreaming
            </p>
            <p>
              Als (hobby) muzikant ben ik altijd al geobsedeerd geweest door de kracht
              van muziek. Over de laatste decennia heeft de wereld van muziek zich
              razendsnel ontwikkeld, en muziek is nu toegankelijk in a kwestie van
              seconden. Mijn passie voor muziek gaat verder dan fan zijn of de melodieën
              en ritmes, maar omsluit ook alles wat de muziek versterkt. Een van de grootste
              aantrekkingskrachten in grafisch ontwerp was en is voor mij de wereld van
              bands met een do-it-yourself mentaliteit en het image wat ze presenteren
              in een digitale wereld. Zo lang als ik mij kan herinneren heb ik in mijn leven
              muziek opgezocht, geluisterd en verzameld.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vóór de komst van internet richtte de discussie over democratisering van
              de muziekindustrie zich op het onderscheid tussen doe-het-zelf-labels,
              onafhankelijke platenlabels en grote platenmaatschappijen. Met het internet
              en digital streaming platforms zoals Spotify en Apple Music in de 21ste eeuw
              is het landschap van muziek maken getransformeerd. Met een paar klikken
              vind je suggesties, gecureerde playlists of dat ene obscure nummer waarvan
              je de vinyl nergens meer kon vinden. Hoe hebben streamingdiensten onze
              relatie met muziek veranderd? Hoe is muziek verandert met de opkomst van
              streaming diensten? In deze thesis onderzoek ik wat deze veranderingen
              betekenen voor zowel muzikant als ontwerper.
            </p>
            <p>Met mijn broer Pim ‘Sebastian Kamae’ de Jonge, 22, als study case, ga ik
              op zoek naar wat voor rol grafisch ontwerp kan spelen in het promoten van
              kleinere, professionele muzikanten op digitale platformen. Daarnaast werken
              we samen aan zijn nieuwe album ‘Enjoy the Ride’ en kijken we wat er komt
              kijken bij de release van een ontworpen, conceptuele plaat in de praktijk.</p>
            <p>In een zoektocht naar een potentiële niche voor grafisch werk na mijn
              afstuderen probeer ik in deze thesis een overzicht te maken van de
              verschillende spelers en technieken die er bij de promotie van artiesten op
              deze platforms komt kijken. Het is een poging om tips, tricks en kennis te
              bundelen en dit toe te passen in het werk dat ik maak en de diensten die ik
              mijn potentiële klanten graag zou willen leveren. Muziek en mijn grafische werk
              staan me nader aan het hart en ik hoop in deze thesis een interessante kijk te
              bieden op een niche in ons werk als ontwerpers en mijn kennis bij te dragen.

            <h3>Chalga – The Music in Bulgarian Life</h3>
            <p>
              Chalga is a Bulgarian music genre, a mixture of Balkan
              rhythm and oriental embellishments. Being the most popular
              music genre in the country, it was intriguing what is it
              really and why the feelings towards it are so mixed. Where
              did it come from and where is it going?
            </p>
            <p>
              Listening to songs and watching videos, reading
              academic papers on Balkan music and talking to various
              artists, academics and casual listeners, I noticed how
              well chalga represents the needs of Bulgarian society. In
              a humorous way, it reflects excessive wealth, enjoyment
              and eroticism that people crave but are ashamed to admit.
              Chalga ties into a much deeper problem of disturbed national
              identity, where it serves as a vent to release all that
              pressure.

            <h3>How Not To Have To Explain Yourself</h3>
            <p>
              K-Pop is a current popular music form that
              derives from South Korea, which has been expanding
              its fame to the global scope for a while
              now. It represents many aspects of globalisation:
              you get to enjoy something that is on the other
              side of the world, you are able to enjoy it from
              home on your screens and it creates a sense of
              unity with fan culture throughout people residing
              in different continents. But at the same time,
              it reflects ambiguities of globalisations too: the
              existing social hierarchies and senseless acts of
              representations are repeated through K-Pop.
              From regressive views on gender to evident
              misogyny, to imperialistic mentality, to extreme
              competitiveness of the industry that turns ambition
              of people into profitable devices. This thesis
              aims to contextualise and understand how
              K-Pop operates and what it represents to the
              global audience of today. Ultimately, an attempt
              to get rid of these views and mentalities will
              suggest how not to have to explain yourself to
              others, the latter being the title of my thesis.

            <p>An Immersion in the Panta Rhei of Liquid Modernity</p>
            <p>
              Around me, I have started to perceive and
              co-experience a kind of uprooting.
              A growing niche of people in Western society
              seems to get disconnected and detached
              from fixed values in life. Stable, life long relationships,
              jobs and residencies are swapped
              for temporary ones.
            </p>
            <p>The speed with which we make connections
              and break them just as easily signifies
              this era. Philosopher and sociologist Zygmunt
              Bauman refers to it as Liquid Modernity, as its
              inhabitants are light and liquid.
              This thesis discusses the root of this shift
              (meritocratic thinking and neoliberalism)
              and some of the ways of being that it affects
              (domestic tendencies, sense of identity and
              sexual orientation).</p>
            <p>Through desk research and a visit into
              the life of someone embodying the symptoms
              of Liquid Modernity, I am hoping to find out if
              we really are light and liquid and if so, what
              are the mental and material repercussions of
              living life in such a manner?</p>

              Lichens are symbiotic organisms deriving from the mutually
              beneficial association of two (sometimes three) individuals:
              a plant and a fungus. There are not two that are alike.
              The fungus provides the structure, mineral salts and water for
              the algae, this in return keeps the fungus alive with organic
              compounds produced by its photosynthesis. If you find some
              you are probably breathing clean air: lichens are very sensitive
              to sulphur dioxide pollution.

            <p>Likewise collaborations between humans seem to depend on
              a similarly fragile balance between mutual interest and the right
              environmental conditions as in cultural and political landscape.</p>
            <p>I started to see many advantages in collaboration as
              a working method after noticing that most of my* projects I
              am satisfied with are fruit of the latter. By aiming to define the
              fragile essence of collaboration I wonder how it coexist with
              increasing rivalry.</p>
            <p>What ways of learning does collaboration generate?
              Can it become a safe space for creating work that is immune
              to competition? And finally, were do we learn to collaborate?</p>

              When you look up the definition of fairy tale you will find
              many descriptions and definitions, vague and wrong, all opinionated.
              The truth is that fairy tales are hard to put in a box,
              they have existed for centuries and have taken thousands of
              different forms. They have this thing, this aura that allows them
              to be told repeatedly for generations. Magic polymorphic,
              any teller can make them his own. To me, it is enough to be
              fascinated by them…. But I am an adult now, and adults are not
              sensitive to fairy tales in general, because they think they’re
              “not meant for them”...As I grew up, I have trouble sharing
              my interests.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m misunderstood.
              “I knew it, of course, she loves fairies and elves
              because she wears pink lol». I am not taken seriously.
              “Clara, fairy tales are not serious matter, they are for
              children.” I can read their eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Well, are they really? I don’t know if people would read
              the story of Little Red Riding Hood to their offspring if they
              knew that the little girl is proposed to “sleep” with the wolf,
              eat her granny, drink her blood…which happens to be the
              first version of the story! Fairy tales bring hope, imagination,
              moral and self-reflection, but also show misogynistic behavior,
              gender discrimination and child abuse. They are insightful
              yet terrific. Are they really for children then? Or are they for
              adults? What makes them childish and why do I think they’re
              not? I was told that life is not a fairy tale. I’ll show you reader,
              that in fact, it is.</p>

              Hoeveel invloed beeld heeft op sociale
              regelgeving en wat is de positie van
              een beeldmaker? Om een mijzelf als beeldmaker en hiermee ook
              anderen een beter perspectief te bieden en om te
              kijken of er is als een neutraal of tijdloos beeld.
              Vrijheid bestaat ook binnen onvrijheid, die ervaring
              van vrijheid is bijna niet vast te houden.
            </p>
            <p>Ook niet in beeld. Ik heb via interviews en het
              analyseren van archief materiaal mezelf een breder
              beeld proberen te geven en nieuwe linken met
              bestaande theorie te leggen.</p>
            <p>Welke rol speelt beeld in het creëren van onvrijheid
              binnen vrijheid rondom de de positie van de
              vrouw in het werkveld?</p>
            <p>Je hebt verschillend beeld, met verschillende
              functies. Ik ben hoopvol dat vrijheid op vele
              manieren ervaren kan worden en dat er betere
              manieren zijn om dit te proberen vorm te geven.</p>
            <p>Een aantal vragen die ik nog heb zijn. In hoe
              verre beïnvloed dat terug kijken dan ook het kijken
              naar de toekomst? kunnen wij beeld maken
              wat daadwerkelijk tijdloos is, of losstaat van een
              sociale regelgeving? En kunnen we beeld maken
              wat ons verlost van sociale regel geving?</p>

            <h3>Kicking Sandcastles and Burning Effigies</h3>
            <p>Destruction has 4 phases, each of them I
              experienced during my experiment.
              It starts with MEANING, the phase the
              destruction gains a conceptual meaning.
            </p>
            <p>
              Phase two is EXITEMENT. During this
              phase, adrenaline will kick in and the fun
              begins. You have to be carefull not to get
              carried away at this point.
            </p>
            <p>
              The third phase is POWER. This is the point
              that the destruction will show it’s potential
              and it’s danger. If used properly, this power
              can change the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, the fourth phase is RELAXATION.
              Your muscles start to relax, your brain is
              at ease and you feel relieved. A weight has
              been lifted off your shoulders.
              The world is now a better place.</p>

            <h3>a Leaf, a Tree, a Screen</h3>
            <p>This artistic research discovers different representations
              of nature through the works and thoughts of several artists,
              writers and filmmakers that have put nature in a contemporary
              context of computer-generated imagery. Contextualising with
              myths and stories, our quest to understand the phenomena of
              nature, leading back in history and time, yet finding ourselves
              until today questioning our relationship with nature. Reminding
              us of the importance of going back to nature and the untouched,
              healing the nostalgia within us, while nature is slowly fading
              in each successive leap in technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the fast development of 3D technology we achieved the
              means and tools of recreating our own natural environment on
              screens and inevitably changed the way we interact and perceive
              nature. This prompted leap in technology has changed our relationship
              with nature at its core, introducing new perspectives of
              views. Replacing the stable and single point of view established
              by the linear through multiple perspectives <sup class='fn'>1</sup> and vertical time <sup class='fn'>2</sup>, as
              3D technologies are capable of twisting and manipulating reality,
              pausing time as a refuge of the eternal. With each alternating
              upswing in technology, we meet our perceived static nature
              shifting; we fear the distance between us and what is natural,
              expanding — soon to be out of reach. Paradoxically, with each
              upswing in technology, we have the means to crawl back into
              new natural environments, artificial, transformed, yet intangible.

              <li>
                Multiple perspective: as a broad theme of possible views, representations and roles;
                We can adopt nature to this theme of holding multiple function and new ways of rethinking it.

              <li> Vertical time: as a term breaking linear time and its concept of a certain past and a uncertain

            <h3>What was that story again? — On Family Lexicons and Anecdotes</h3>
            <p>There is a thing that we’ve been saying in
              my family for a while now: every time that
              somebody wants to suggest something
              to do, the person says: ‘Ho pensato… !’
              (I was thinking… !), and then we all start
              laughing. This started happening because
              my grandmother starts almost all
              of her speeches in her personal way of
              pronouncing ‘Ho pensato… !’
            </p>
            <p>
              By taking family lexicons and anecdotes as its main
              subjects of investigation, my thesis is an attempt to dive into
              family traditions and memories, and understand what they
              represent and how they influence our upbringing and development
              of personal identity. I am interested in discerning
              the meaning and symbolism of these small stories, traits and
              habits in a broader context, trying to map out how they can
              affect our social interactions with a collectivity.
            </p>
            <p>In my research I analyze the role of oral tradition and
              narratives as a vehicle to portray, preserve and hand down personal
              family heritage and history. I examine oral narratives as
              tools to pass on not only tradition, culture, habits and values,
              but also unhealed traumas, taboos, internal conflicts throughout
              generations.</p>
            <p>The writing focuses on different aspects of the subject,
              such as: the performative quality of family stories, the ordinariness
              of these anecdotes, the family dynamics that these
              episodes bring to light, the iconicity that terms and stories
              acquire with time, the openness to manipulation that oral
              narratives have.</p>
            <p>The thesis, which presents itself as a collage of personal
              experiences and external references (such as conversations
              with my close ones), aims to unravel the relationship between
              personal and collective memories and situations.</p>

            <h3>Brainchild of Humanity</h3>

            <p>In my thesis I investigate the empathic relationship between
              humans and robot/interfaces. I have always been fascinated by
              robots since I was a child, but, at the same time I did, and still
              do, find them them very unsettling. There is something about
              this non-human factor that captivates me and that drives me
              to dig into this subject.
            </p>
            <p>
              I want to find out how can aesthetics assist in this
              process of designing empathy in lifeless machines. And what
              can I do, from the perspective of a designer, to make this process
              easier and faster? I have been approaching this subject in many
              different ways: I’ve been reading articles from the MIT social
              robots group and explored into Japan’s tradition of animism.
              In my study cases I focus especially on children’s social robots.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a designer, I am a mediator in between these two worlds,
              exactly like I am this mediator in my stories: first I write in the
              position of humans, then I write in the position of a robot. This
              approach helped me exploring this topic in a more experimental
              and personal way and made me reflect on my own empathy
              towards the characters of the stories as well.</p>

            <h3>HOT MONSTER COMPOST</h3>

            <p>An investigation of fan-art depicting animal-human
              hybrid figures and explicitly sexualized monsters online.
            </p>
            <p>
              These artworks display imaginative use of the animal-
              human hybrid figure, that often differs from the
              most common and normalized use, for example depicting
              a sexualized reptile pin-up instead of the more
              commonly represented enigmatic cat-lady. Besides, the
              popularity of these images alone, as reflected by the
              frequency of which they are made, commented on and
              shared, is reason enough to study them.
            </p>
            <p>
              The fan-artists’ productivity is incredibly high, often for
              no reward other than the gratitude of their followers. I
              explore both the oppressive, othering and the emancipatory
              effects of representations of hybrid figures,
              as well as conditions under which the animal-human
              figure is positive.</p>

            <p>I lean heavily on other critical thinkers in my text to give
              perspective to my research. Core examples are Mel Y.
              Chen and her book Animacies, Eve K. Sedgwick and
              her essay “Paranoid Reading and Reparative Reading”,
              Andrea Chu Long and her essay draft “Did Sissy
              Porn Make Me Trans?” and Ursula K. Le Guin and her
              essay “The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction”.</p>

            <p>I reached out to the artists and conducted interviews
              with Camille Cailloux (FlyingRotten on Twitter and
              Instagram), Darkoshen (DeviantArt) and Dracowhip
              (DeviantArt). I explore both the divide and overlap
              between the intent behind their images and how they
              are received and used by the audience. The crossinvestigation
              of illustrations, interviews and theory give
              an insight into how becoming an object by choice and
              through fantasy can be both desirable and necessary
              for alternative storytelling and new erotic experiences.</p>

            <p>What started as a small local environmental
              movement for addressing climate injustice
              grew, and in one year became a global
              resistance to business as usual, while our
              planet’s decades are being counted. The people
              go to the streets, block roads and ask their
              governments to act immediately. These
              events sparked hope in millions but the
              governments just ignored them. The science
              is clear as day, yet the world seems to be
              paralysed in it’s addiction to consumerism. By
              studying disasters I learned about different
              aspects of human behavior in extreme
              circumstances. I synthesise my findings into a
              term Hyperdisaster. I explore what exactly
              it means and how I can use it to look at the
              changing landscape of civilisation.

            <h3>The body as a political vehicle in Russia</h3>

            <p>This thesis examined the relatively recent emergence of
              body-protest art in Russia, which replaced a literary text.
              This shift can be nearly equally attributed to the cultural,
              socio-political and economic shifts after the collapse of
              the Soviet Union.
            </p>
            <p>Analyzing works of Petr Pavlensky and other activists
              as an example of a new movement in the Russian art and
              revealing particulars of using the body in political protesting
              discourse, I would like to answer the question: what
              led to the appearance of such a body representation in
              Russia?</p>
            <p>Perhaps a secret of understanding actions of Pavlensky
              explained in his favourite phrase: “The history of art
              is the history of a clash of a man and power”, where the
              legacy of Michel Foucault is noticeable. I also examine
              historical significance of literature in the Russian society
              before considering changes.</p>
            <p>Mass media propaganda creates a certain veil that
              does not let make correct assessment of the political
              situation in Russia. I hope that I will slightly reveal this veil
              in an attempt to demonstrate and clarify the picture in
              Russia without hiding anything from outsiders.</p>

            <p>Through the usage of metaphors and
              visual metaphors a representation of meteorological
              phenomena has been created.
              This Thesis will focus not so much on the
              weather itself, but on the recreation of the
              weather in the imagination of individuals.
              The weather is deeply rooted in how humans
              understand and experience the world. It is
              one of the topics that for thousands of years
              has been left to religion to explain. Only
              during the past 300 years have we been able
              to better understand why these phenomena
              occur.

            <p>Only through the help of technology
              and human ingenuity and imagination have
              we reached this current point in time, where
              the sky has finally unraveled most of its
              secrets. Through the analysis of historical
              representations of these phenomena, I hope
              to unravel how we perceive contemporary-
              weather in the past and in the future.</p>

            <p class="quote">“Weather is the key paradox of our time.
              Weather that is nice is often weather that is

            <h3>Towards Mobility: Becoming Liquid Autonomy</h3>

            <p> This text considers the implications of mobility on the
              neoliberal subject, both living and working environments,
              suggesting that under globalised conditions of precarity,
              inequality, and lack, which ultimately is not sufficient anymore
              for designers to stay mobile and autonomous in the
              long run. We find ourselves physically and mentally liquid
              and flexible. It departs from looking at myself reflected in
              the window, where home decorations are permanently
              displayed. I explore ways that certain objects are ultimately
              directing the subject to search for social-construction,
              and to spend energy maintaining individual. I
              draw a parallel with the freelance designer today where
              the work has become liquid and hybrid by mobility, and
              in what aspects can they be oriented to maintain autonomy
              in relation to our behavior. I take a look at the subject
              through my own experiences and observations on different
              locations as I move, such as houses, parties, streets,
              and cafes and use them to provide historically and theoretically
              defined research to articulate my perception
              of the mobility. We might be exposed to the dangers that
              are veiled by neoliberalism through media, classification,
              rights and now security, behaviour, and identity. To maintain
              our autonomy, such structures needed to be built
              and the cooperative is a model to develop our autonomy
              in a hybrid and liquid world.

            <h3>In the world of ghazal, I’m a fleet-flooted galloping gazelle</h3>

            <p>My country, a veiled society.
              <br>
              My country, do I belong here?</p>
            <p> My thesis brings together narratives from the perspective of a hybrid identity
              and being conflicted with or exposed to gender inequality, segregation, racism
              and violence in Iran and in the Netherlands.<sup class='fn'>1</sup> This hybrid identity constitutes
              itself across two cultures and two identities. One of them being, an identity
              searching for the meaning of belonging. <sup class='fn'>2</sup> The other, an identity in a veiled
              society.<sup class='fn'>3</sup>
              Highlighting these differences from my background make me understand the connection,
              of me being an individual woman in-between the two cultures better.
            </p>
            <p>I’ve always found it interesting why women have to conceal their bodies, because
              of claims that “men cannot control their sexuality”. The men have been so powerful
              throughout history, always dictating the lives of others, of women. Not
              only in Iran but, in all societies, we have been dealing with dominance by men
              and overwhelming control by men. With this thesis I saw an opportunity to
              address this issue by using poetry (paradoxically enough has been an important
              part of Iranian culture), to create my own ghazals.<sup class='fn'>4</sup> Today, Iranian women are
              “repressed prisoners” of a patriarchal culture that traditionally prevents the growth
              of female subjects. This for me was reason enough to write about my own experiences.</p>
            <p>I will take the reader through a poetic narrative of realities in what I coin “a
              veiled society”. Within the space of my layout of this thesis I experiment with
              the footnotes and the legal paragraphs of the Iranian constitution (Sharia), and thus
              make it more understandable and show how these vague constitutions and
              laws forcefully suppress Iranian people and their right to speak up. Therefore,
              through the notion of fiction, I am able to be a voice to the voiceless, to symbolize
              what has been taken away by the laws of the constitution.</p>

                feeling that you are allowed to be yourself
                there. Her discussion of trauma and
                the need for psychological healing is also a
                key driving force behind her discussion of

                the problematic regime in the Islamic
                Republic of Iran that the Iranian people
                are facing. It is a personal account,
                written – from my point of view as an
                Iranian woman – who has grown up in
                the Netherlands.</li>

            <h3>“Deep Surfaces”</h3>

            <p> In my bachelor thesis I focus on the
              concepts of surface as techne. I track
              the outset of the technical flatness
              back to the accessory used by the
              archaic accountants. I analyse how the
              re-invention of the surface for economy
              shaped the social structures of the
              first city-states. Next, I inspect the
              production process of the capitalist
              fetishised shine embodied in a polished
              car body. I speculate on how the linear
              movement of the conveyor belt’s surface
              as well as the catered sequences of
              the first film projections shifted
              the agency of a user. I present the
              haunting, zoomorphic surface of an
              oil film as the ultimate product of
              the ‘turbo-capitalism,’ as coined by
              Susan Schuppli. Finally, I focus on the
              concept of the vibrant surface within.
              I inquire about the crystalline surfaces
              of today’s screens, which resonate with
              conductive proteins in our bodies.
              Together, they extrude and transcend
              the flatness into the impenetrable
              architectures of power.
