          <h3>The Alchemical Recipe for Data Transmutation</h3>
          <p>The Alchemical arts, technology and the historical
            art of memory are connected in more ways that one
            could possibly imagine. Daily, we store and recollect
            information and imagery inside the architecture of our
            minds and transform the worth according to our inner
            hierarchical file system.<sup class='fn'>1</sup> The structure in which we
            store memory has been explored by many throughout
            history, especially by those interested in the occult.
            Combining the alchemy of the mind and computing
            terms, I wish to explore the space in which memory
            is stored through the eyes of the contemporary artist.
            The exploration dives both in the physical and the
            digital, for many of the memory system, such as ‘The
            Theatre of the World’ by Robert Fludd, are based on
            an architectural structure surrounding logic and order,
            very much like the modern algorithm. In this thesis,
            I will research the deeper connection between the
            transmutation <sup class='fn'>2</sup> of value within the Alchemical arts in
            correlation to memory and the methods of archiving
            and data storage in the digital realm, questioning if
            modern tools such as the algorithm and the hard drive
            could be the contemporary alchemical ingredients that
            together create the recipe for the transmutation of data.</p>

          <p>Destruction has 4 phases, each of them I
            experienced during my experiment.
            It starts with MEANING, the phase the
            destruction gains a conceptual meaning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Phase two is EXITEMENT. During this
            phase, adrenaline will kick in and the fun
            begins. You have to be carefull not to get
            carried away at this point.

          </p>
          <p>
            The third phase is POWER. This is the point
            that the destruction will show it’s potential
            and it’s danger. If used properly, this power
            can change the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, the fourth phase is RELAXATION.
            Your muscles start to relax, your brain is
            at ease and you feel relieved. A weight has
            been lifted off your shoulders.
            The world is now a better place.</p>

          <h3> Brainchild of Humanity</h3>

          <p>In my thesis I investigate the empathic relationship between
            humans and robot/interfaces. I have always been fascinated by
            robots since I was a child, but, at the same time I did, and still
            do, find them them very unsettling. There is something about
            this non-human factor that captivates me and that drives me
            to dig into this subject.
          </p>
          <p>
            I want to find out how can aesthetics assist in this
            process of designing empathy in lifeless machines. And what
            can I do, from the perspective of a designer, to make this process
            easier and faster? I have been approaching this subject in many
            different ways: I’ve been reading articles from the MIT social
            robots group and explored into Japan’s tradition of animism.
            In my study cases I focus especially on children’s social robots.
          </p><br>
          <p>
            As a designer, I am a mediator in between these two worlds,
            exactly like I am this mediator in my stories: first I write in the
            position of humans, then I write in the position of a robot. This
            approach helped me exploring this topic in a more experimental
            and personal way and made me reflect on my own empathy
            towards the characters of the stories as well.</p>

          <p>The valuable essence of fairy tales
            against the prejudices of adulthood.
          </p>
          <p class="quote">“There is no such a thing as The Fairy tale. There are Fairy tales.
            When we see them we know them; we sense that they are.
            I congratulate writers for bringing our ageless anxieties and
            hopes once more to light through the hypnotic and clinical lens
            that is fairy tales”.
            <br>
            Jack Zipes.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you look up the definition of fairy tale you will find
            many descriptions and definitions, vague and wrong, all opinionated.
            The truth is that fairy tales are hard to put in a box,
            they have existed for centuries and have taken thousands of
            different forms. They have this thing, this aura that allows them
            to be told repeatedly for generations. Magic polymorphic,
            any teller can make them his own. To me, it is enough to be
            fascinated by them…. But I am an adult now, and adults are not
            sensitive to fairy tales in general, because they think they’re
            “not meant for them”...As I grew up, I have trouble sharing
            my interests.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m misunderstood.
            “I knew it, of course, she loves fairies and elves
            because she wears pink lol». I am not taken seriously.
            “Clara, fairy tales are not serious matter, they are for
            children.” I can read their eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, are they really? I don’t know if people would read
            the story of Little Red Riding Hood to their offspring if they
            knew that the little girl is proposed to “sleep” with the wolf,
            eat her granny, drink her blood…which happens to be the
            first version of the story! Fairy tales bring hope, imagination,
            moral and self-reflection, but also show misogynistic behavior,
            gender discrimination and child abuse. They are insightful
            yet terrific. Are they really for children then? Or are they for
            adults? What makes them childish and why do I think they’re
            not? I was told that life is not a fairy tale. I’ll show you reader,
            that in fact, it is.</p>
